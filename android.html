     <h1>Our Project Game</h1>
	 <h2>Description</h2>
	 <h2>Reflections</h2>
	 <p>Kimberlys:Personally, I think the game turned out pretty well with all the basic functions we had planned, but I wish we had more time to add extra functionalities such as power-ups. The hardest part of making this app was programming the blocks to move with two second increments between each other. Since the MIT App Inventor doesn’t have a ‘wait’ function, we couldn’t easily program the blocks within a loop. We ended up having to use five separate clocks, one for each block, to time the start of their movement.</p>
     <p>Mackenzie Barton:I was happy with what we ended up making from this project. Even though it did not turn out like  how we had originally planned, I still think this project was still fun. One of the problems i had was how App Inventor’s buttons work, by how  difficult it was to try and move the buttons to where we wanted them. I would have liked to have added a background to our game but that can be done at a later point. Overall I am happy with what we created, I hope that other people will find it fun too.</p>
