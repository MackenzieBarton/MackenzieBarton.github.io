     <h1>Our Project Game</h1>
	 <h2>Description</h2>
	 <p>We are wanting to create a project where the player must avoid falling platforms. The goal of the game is to see how far the player can go before they run into a platform. We originally wanted to create a game like doodle jump, where the players advance by jumping on platforms. As the player progress the speed of the game increases and the number of platforms decrease.  We are also thinking of including power ups that the player can receive to advance farther in the game.</p>
	 <h2>Reflections</h2>
	 <p>Kimberlys:Personally, I think the game turned out pretty well with all the basic functions we had planned, but I wish we had more time to add extra functionalities such as power-ups. The hardest part of making this app was programming the blocks to move with two second increments between each other. Since the MIT App Inventor doesn’t have a ‘wait’ function, we couldn’t easily program the blocks within a loop. We ended up having to use five separate clocks, one for each block, to time the start of their movement.</p>
     <p>Mackenzie Barton:I was happy with what we ended up making from this project. Even though it did not turn out like  how we had originally planned, I still think this project was still fun. One of the problems i had was how App Inventor’s buttons work, by how  difficult it was to try and move the buttons to where we wanted them. I would have liked to have added a background to our game but that can be done at a later point. Overall I am happy with what we created, I hope that other people will find it fun too.</p>

	 <h3>Explaination</h3>
	 <p>In this code we made it so that all the platforms had to be a certain length away from each other. It was challenging at first to decide what code was needed in order to acomplishes what we wanted. We thought it was important that a function like this existed because without it all the platforms started to clump together.
