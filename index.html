		 <h2>Description</h2>
		 <p>I have created a calculator, it does pretty much all the basics multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting.</p>
		 <p>It has the functions of making the number you want negative or positive. It Will also allow the use of decimals. </p>
		 <p>It has been given memory functions: will store a number, return it, or will clear it altogether.</p>
		 
		 <div align="center"><h2>Reflections</h2></div>
		 <p>This project was kinda fun, at least now I have a mini calculator. I would of liked to of add parentheses, but that was not something I could easily figured out. I am glad I could of add the memory functions, because I think they make it seem more like a real calculator    </p>

		 <p>This part was challenging to me, trying to get ride of the .0 after a function was made  </p>
